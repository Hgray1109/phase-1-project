          The White Walkers were an ancient race of formerly-human ice creatures
          who came from the Far North of Westeros. After remaining hidden for
          thousands of years, they returned. The White Walkers were thousands of
          years old, coming from the time preceding the Age of Heroes. Born of
          powerful and untested magic, they were created to protect the Children
          of the Forest from the First Men, who had waged war on them ever since
          they had arrived from Essos. However, the White Walkers eventually
          broke free of the Children's control and became the most feared
          creatures in Westeros, posing a threat to anything living.
